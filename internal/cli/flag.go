Flags must be specified before positional arguments in the CLI command.
For example "squire up -example positional-arg" not "squire up positional-arg -example".
Please reorder your arguments and try again.

Note: we can't automatically fix this or allow this since we can't safely
detect what you want as flag arguments and what you want as positional arguments.
The underlying library we use for flag parsing (the Go standard library)
enforces this requirement. Sorry!
